# C-Objects-and-Classes

 In this project, I will use C++ programming language to build a Profile class that allows users to generate profile objects.

The Profile should store the following information:

User’s name
User’s age
User’s city
User’s country
User’s pronouns
User’s hobbies
And this is how users should be able to interact with their own profiles:

Create a new profile with some information
Add hobbies
View profile.
